  };
}
```

## Conclusion

The refund management system now provides a complete solution for all user roles:

- **Buyers** can request refunds (existing functionality)

- **Admins** can manage and approve/reject all refunds

The implementation follows the existing design patterns and maintains consistency with the rest of the platform while providing the necessary functionality for effective refund management.
