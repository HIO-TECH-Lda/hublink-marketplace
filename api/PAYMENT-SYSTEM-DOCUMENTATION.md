# Payment System Documentation

## Overview

The Txova Marketplace API includes a comprehensive payment system that supports multiple payment methods and provides secure, reliable payment processing. The system is built with TypeScript, integrates with Stripe for online payments, and supports manual payment methods for offline transactions.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Payment Model** (`src/models/Payment.ts`)
   - Comprehensive payment schema with status tracking
   - Virtual properties for status checking
   - Instance methods for payment operations
   - Static methods for payment queries

2. **Payment Service** (`src/services/paymentService.ts`)
   - Business logic for payment processing
   - Stripe integration and webhook handling
   - Refund processing and manual payment management

3. **Payment Controller** (`src/controllers/paymentController.ts`)
   - RESTful API endpoints for payment operations
   - Request validation and error handling
   - Role-based access control

4. **Payment Routes** (`src/routes/payment.ts`)
   - Route definitions with middleware
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Input validation

## üí≥ Supported Payment Methods

### 1. Stripe (Online Payments)
- **Supported Cards**: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover
- **Currencies**: USD, EUR, MZN (Mozambican Metical)
- **Features**: 
  - Secure payment processing
  - Real-time payment status updates
  - Automatic fraud detection
  - Webhook integration for instant notifications

### 2. Manual Payments (Offline)
- **Bank Transfer**: Direct bank transfers
- **Cash on Delivery**: Cash payment upon delivery
- **Features**:
  - Manual payment tracking

    API->>Database: Update Payment Status
    API->>Database: Update Order Status
    API->>Client: Payment Confirmed
```

## üìä Payment Status Workflow

```
pending ‚Üí processing ‚Üí completed
    ‚Üì
failed ‚Üê ‚Üí refunded
```

### Status Descriptions

- **pending**: Payment intent created, awaiting completion
- **processing**: Payment is being processed by gateway
- **completed**: Payment successfully completed
- **failed**: Payment failed or was declined
- **refunded**: Payment was refunded (partial or full)

## üîê Security Features

### 1. Stripe Integration Security
- **Webhook Signature Verification**: All webhook events are verified using Stripe's signature
- **API Key Management**: Secure storage of Stripe API keys in environment variables
- **PCI Compliance**: Stripe handles all sensitive payment data (no card data stored locally)

### 2. Payment Data Security
- **No Sensitive Data Storage**: Payment card information is never stored in the database
- **Transaction ID Tracking**: Only Stripe transaction IDs are stored for reference
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail for all payment operations

### 3. Access Control
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Different payment operations require specific roles
- **User Ownership**: Users can only access their own payment information
- **Admin Oversight**: Administrative functions require admin privileges
